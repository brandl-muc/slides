\begin{lstlisting}
class Derived : private Base
{};
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item all public and protected members of \code{Base} are accessible as private members of the derived class
\item private members of the base are never accessible unless friended
\item instances of \code{Derived} cannot be cast to \code{Base} as this relationship is inaccessible outside of \code{Derived}
\end{itemize}

Consequently this models HAS-A instead of IS-A.\\
But \cite{favor composition over inheritance} is also valid here, so HAS-A is better modelled by using a member variable because this causes less coupling. Also one is less likely to violate the Liskov Substitution Principle.

\frametitle{Exceptions to the rule}
%\framesubtitle{To every rule there is an exception}
Private inheritance should be used if one does not want to model IS-A but
\begin{itemize}
\item needs to override a virtual function
\item needs access to a protected member
\item needs to create an object before / destroy it after another base
\item needs to share a virtual base or needs to control the construction of a virtual base
\item wants to make use of the Empty Base Optimization, e.g. with policy-based design
\end{itemize}
